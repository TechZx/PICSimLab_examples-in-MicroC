# PICSimLab_examples_in_MicroC
Examples of basic functions in programming a PIC microprocessor using MicroC editor and PICSimlab for testing.
The examples are made for PIC18F452 Clock:8

There are given some example codes for some functionalities as Interrupts,ADC,Steppers/servo Motors,I2C etc so the basics can be explained.

Warning: Micro C and PIC Simlab are both difficult to use as they have a lot of buggs and it is quite possible for obstacles to appear.
